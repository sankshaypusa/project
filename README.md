# 18BD1A05BM-Project_1 :-INVENTORY TRACKING SYSTEM
Inventory management of critical health care infrastructure including real time usage tracking has become inevitable following the current pandemic.
This project aims at building an inventory tracking system for ventilators that allows authorized hospital users to input details of the available inventory and tag it as “occupied”, “available” and “in-maintenance”. The three status can also be updated using a secure API for real time usage metrics. The application should have the ability to also add any ventilator to a specific hospital and search ventilators which are available.

=>the details  regarding information related to medical inventory in hospitals are displayed in third party app known POSTMAN
  
 1)Postman is a standalone software testing API platform to test, design, modify, and document APIs. 

2)It is a simple Graphic User Interface for sending and viewing HTTP requests and responses.

3)While using Postman, for testing purposes, one doesn't need to write any HTTP client network code. Instead, we build test suites called collections and let Postman interact with the API.

4)This tool has the ability to make various types of HTTP requests like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.

=>Why Postman?

1)Accessibility- One can use it anywhere after installing Postman into the device by simply logging in to the account.

2)Use Collections-Postman allows users to build collections for their API-calls. Every set can create multiple requests and subfolders. It will help to organize the test suites.

3)Automation Testing-Tests can be performed in several repetitions or iterations by using the Collection Runner, which saves time for repeated tests.

4)Debugging- To effectively debug the tests, the postman console helps to track what data is being retrieved.
