# 18BD1A05BM-Project_1 :-INVENTORY TRACKING SYSTEM
Inventory management of critical health care infrastructure including real time usage tracking has become inevitable following the current pandemic.
This project aims at building an inventory tracking system for ventilators that allows authorized hospital users to input details of the available inventory and tag it as “occupied”, “available” and “in-maintenance”. The three status can also be updated using a secure API for real time usage metrics. The application should have the ability to also add any ventilator to a specific hospital and search ventilators which are available.
